The PHP SDK and MediaWiki integrations were introduced into Alfresco Community Edition by Alfresco 2.0.

This functionality was never moved into Enterprise Edition and was never officially supported by Alfresco.

The PHP SDK was not maintained by Alfresco after version 3.1.

With the release of Alfresco 4.0, the PHP SDK was migrated to this Google Code project for community support.
